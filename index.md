## About Me

I'm an undegraduate senior in Computer Science & Engineering at the [University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez](https://www.uprm.edu/). Currently, I am part of the [Edge Computing Group](https://edge-computing-upr.github.io/web) under advisement of [Dr. Wilfredo Lugo Beauchamp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilfredo-lugo-beauchamp-0b083838/) working on developing memory-efficient models for on-device processing of biomedical dynsfunction (e.g., anemia, low hemoglobin). [NSF Award OIA-1849243]. I also founded [Capicú](https://capicupuertorico.com), a deep tech startup specialized in deploying ML models optimized for your target hardware, with a focus on biomedical and medical tech. With a strong background in Data Science & Engineering, Biomedical Informatics, and Machine Learning, I'm eager to explore opportunities towards a career as a scientist-entrepeneur.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** biomedical imaging, electron microscopy analysis
- **Machine Learning:** statistical learning, transfer learning

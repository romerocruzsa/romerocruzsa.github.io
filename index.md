## About Me

I am an undergraudate senior in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez. Currently, I work at the Edge Computing Group under advisement of Dr. Wilfredo Lugo Beauchamp working on developing memory-efficient models for on-device processing of anemia detection in *conjunctiva pallor* (inner eyelid) [NSF Award OIA-1849243]. With a strong background in Data Science & Engineering, Statistical Modeling, and Machine Learning, I am looking for full-time opportunities in Bioinformatics, Data Analytics, and AI/ML upon graduation.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** biomedical imaging, electron microscopy analysis
- **Machine Learning:** statistical learning, transfer learning
- **Biology:** molecular biology, genetics and genomics, precision medicine
- **Biomedical Engineering:** accesible healthtech, on-device monitoring, disease prevention

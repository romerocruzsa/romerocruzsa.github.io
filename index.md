## About Me

I am an **undergraudate senior** in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://uprm.edu/cse) at the [University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez](https://uprm.edu). 

While my academic training is in engineering and computing, I do have a keen interest in the life sciences and research. Particularly, my interests align in two things: **computational approaches to biological phenomena**. Currently, I am part of the [Edge Computing Group](https://github.com/edge-computing-upr) through the **[NSF-EPSCoR Center for the Advancement of Wearable Technologies (CAWT)](https://cawt.upr.edu) Undergraduate Research Fall Internship 2024** under advisement of [Dr. Wilfredo Lugo Beauchamp]() working on developing Deep Learning models to detect anemia through the interior part of the eyelid (*conjunctiva pallor*) whilst making them efficient in resource-limited environments through battery-powered devices. [*NSF Award OIA-1849243*].

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** biomedical imaging, electron microscopy analysis
- **Machine Learning:** statistical learning, transfer learning
- **Biology:** molecular biology, genetics and genomics, precision medicine
- **Biomedical Engineering:** accesible healthtech, on-device monitoring, disease prevention

excerpt: "This is more than a first post. It's a declaration — that science is personal, curiosity is power, and purpose can be programmed."

I didn’t grow into science by chasing perfect grades or early accolades. I grew into it by asking questions that wouldn’t leave me alone — questions about the body, the brain, about how biology can break, and how code can help it heal.

This is my first blog post. But more than that, it’s a small marker of something bigger: that **curiosity**, **compassion**, and **integrity** are the truest compilers of who I am.

## “Somos el rocío cuando se desayuna...”

One of my favorite songs that captures the essence of Puerto Rico, *La Isla del Encanto*, and the place I call home is *Hijos del Cañaveral* by Residente. At one point, the lyrics say,

***“Somos el rocío cuando se desayuna; somos la marea cuando baila con la luna; nos secamos el sudor con el viento, sin toalla; y nos perfumamos con la sal de la playa.”***

*🎧 Listen from 2:13 to 2:24 — the verse that shaped my view of identity and resilience.* -->

Nature becomes a metaphor for identity, resilience, and spirit. The rocío (dew) and marea (tide) symbolize fluidity and adaptability, reflecting a people in harmony with their environment. The line *“Nos secamos el sudor con el viento, sin toalla”* speaks to endurance—how struggle is embraced without complaint. *“Nos perfumamos con la sal de la playa”* reinforces the idea that identity is deeply rooted in the island itself—there is pride in simplicity, in being shaped by the land rather than material wealth.

Home and everyone within it have compelled me to become the person I needed when I was younger, paving the way for others to go further than I ever could. I am a mosaic of necessity, love, anger, and triumph, knowing my purpose is not just to achieve success, but to bring others with me. As I reflect on my academic journey, one word stands out: gratitude. I aim to pursue graduate studies abroad to gain the knowledge and skills to return home as a professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, fostering undergraduate research and creating opportunities for the next generation.

## Let’s Talk About What Comes Next

I dream of returning to Puerto Rico — not just with a degree, but with momentum. I want to teach. Build programs. Create space for others to dream bigger, earlier. I want to be the professor I needed when I was 18, wondering if it was okay to love both code and chromosomes.

This blog is part of that mission. Part reflection, part roadmap, part call to others doing the hard, beautiful work of building a future they’ve never seen before.

*Let’s talk about purpose.  
Let’s talk about people.  
Let’s talk about **what’s possible** when curiosity has a cause.*
